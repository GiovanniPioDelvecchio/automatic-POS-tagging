# POS-tagging tool based on GloVe embeddings

Repository for first NLP course assignment.

For a complete explaination of the the project refer to the pdf report.

The project consists in the creation of a model for Part of Speech tagging
through means of GloVe embeddings of sentences, passed to a 
small recurrent neural network followed by a time-distributed dense layer.
This project was developed in Keras and trained on a fraction of the
NLTK corpus for POS-tagging.
